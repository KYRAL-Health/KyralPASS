# KyralPASS<sup>TM</sup>

> **KyralPass<sup>TM</sup> is a secure digital passport for the verification of any credential.**

KyralPASS is a decentralized, community-based digital pass for identifications, vaccinations, or any other credentials for yourself, your community, or your organization, regardless of its size. The technology is built on an open-source, private, enterprise-grade blockchain platform based on Hyperledger Fabric. KyralPass evolved from previous iterations dubbed the Sankofa Healthcare Framework (SHF) for the sharing of immunization records, where Sankofa is a mythical bird that symbolizes learning from past knowledge and wisdom, and means "go back and get it" in the Twi culture of the Akan people of Ghana.

Kyral in KyralPASS refers to the chirality of molecules in the universe, specifically DNA, the inspiration for this endeavor and, therefore, of life itself - where chiral structures act as a form of information storage similar to zeros and ones, mirror images which are non-superimposable but can exist in both forms, and thus digitally equivalent but unique. Also known as enantiomers, chirality brings diversity and the possibility of mirror worlds, or what some refer to as a "mirror life". There is nothing more valuable in this world than your genetic data or that of your family or your communities.

We originally envisioned Kyral as a digital, distributed ledger-based vaccination pass or immunization scheme in 2019 - before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, and more than a year before mandates by organizations and governments to institute secure COVID-19 vaccination credentials and passports. The scope of this project was to setup a vaccination pass and immunization record system between multiple parties: initially a hospital, a pharmacy, and a university, which mandated students have immunization histories and more recently, have been vaccinated for COVID-19, prior to attendance.

KYRALâ€™s vision is to reimagine health, healthcare, and privacy in a connected future, such as the one necessitated by the pandemic.

## Contributing to KyralPASS

KyralPASS was born at KYRAL Health, but belongs to the community. We are releasing the KyralPass platform to the public to allow any individual, group, institution, or organization to create their own secure, internal credentialing system and join the larger, global network that comprises KyralNET. Joining this agnostic, decentralized network will enable secure, private cross-verification of credentials between individuals, groups, institutions, and organizations that make up KyralNET.

Review our [Contributor Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
